# ⭐ Facial Fidelity — Machine Learning Based Face Restoration & Recognition

## 📌 Overview
Facial Fidelity is a Machine Learning and Computer Vision project designed to enhance and recognize faces from blurred, noisy, or low-light images. The system improves degraded facial images using deep learning–based restoration and then performs identity matching using similarity metrics.

This project focuses on solving real-world challenges where traditional facial recognition fails due to poor image quality, such as surveillance footage and low-light environments.
